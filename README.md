# Twitch-Engagement
The Twitch gamer ecosystem

Twitch has been an oasis for gamers for over 10 years now! Creating an iconic gaming community and building a long term fanbase for gamers who want to showcase their skills while entertaining others.

This sparked my interest as a gamer and as someone who believes in the future of internet economics. Twitch has created many internet figures that later on went on to become influencers, musicians and even actors. I wanted to find out how many hours gamers are streaming on a yearly basis in order to create this fanbase by looking at their acquired views and followers during that year's time frame.

Eventually pushing me to take a deeper look at the streaming analytics and see if the results we find can be applied to other social media streaming platforms.
